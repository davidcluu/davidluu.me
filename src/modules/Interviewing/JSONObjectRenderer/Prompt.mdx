# JSON Object Renderer

Given an input JavaScript object, implement a component that renders the object.

For simplicity, only values that are valid JSON data types (null, boolean, number, string, array, object) need to be considered. <HideIf comparision={Comparision.GreaterThan} level={1} />

Objects should be rendered as follows:
* null - `null`
* boolean - The stringified boolean value (i.e. `true` or `false`)
* number - The stringified number (e.g. `123`)
* string - The string wrapped with apostrophes (e.g. `"Hello World!"`)
* array - The rendered elements of the array, each separated by a comma and a newline. The elements should be wrapped with a square bracket.

```json
[
  null,
  true,
  1
]
```

* object - The key/rendered value pairs of the object, separated by a colon. The pairs should be wrapped with curly braces.

```json
{
  foo: "bar",
  one: 2
}
```

In addition, non-flat elements (arrays and objects) should have a button that expands and collapses the element and all of its children. <HideIf comparision={Comparision.GreaterThan} level={2}>Children arrays and objects can remain collapsed/uncollapsed when the parent array or object is expanded again.</HideIf> When collapsed, the object should instead be rendered as follows:

* array - The number of items in the array, wrapped with a square bracket (e.g. `[42]`)
* object - The number of key/values in the object, wrapped with curly braces (e.g. `{42}`)

The unicode characters ⮞ (expand; U+2B9E) and ⮟ (collapse; U+2B9F) can be used as the text for the expand/collapse buttons. <HideIf comparision={Comparision.GreaterThan} level={1} />
