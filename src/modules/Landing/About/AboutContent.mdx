## Hello World!

My name is David and I'm a software engineer based in the S.F. Bay Area. I currently work for Amazon in the [Amazon Smart Vehicles](https://amazon.com/alexaauto) organization building software and services that enable Alexa to deliver cutting-edge voice-driven experiences in the personal mobility domain.

I have an excellent track record of successfully delivering business critical software to customers. I am always looking for opportunities to learn grow and create meaningful change in the world through software. Currently, I am primarily interested in working on internet-scale distributed systems that leverages computation to disrupt and enhance existing experiences.

When I'm not coding, I like playing basketball üèÄ, golfing ‚õ≥, cooking üë®‚Äçüç≥, and playing with my <LouieAge /> Australian Shepherd, Louie üê∂.
