### Amazon, Sunnyvale, CA | SDE II - Devices Supply Chain Optimization | July 2019 to February 2020

* Implemented, tested, and released an enhancement to an internal microservices framework that allowed for the creation of transactions that atomically mutate entities across multiple microservices. Services that onboarded onto the transactions library were shown to only incur an average penalty of 10 ms per mutation in a production environment.
* Designed, implemented and released a microservice that automatically assigns and notifies reviewers for bill of material (BOM) changes based on a series of flexible user-configured business rules applied to various aspects of the change, such as parts changed, type of change, and lifecycle state of the BOM. 
* Implemented and iterated on an 2-week agile scrum process (product/development backlogs, backlog grooming, point poker, sprint retrospective, and sprint demos) to organize and streamline team development efforts. <!-- impact? -->
